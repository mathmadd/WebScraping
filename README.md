# WebScraping
Work in Progress - Simple web scraper that checks the availability of Rogue Fitness kettlebells. If so, it adds specified kettlebell to cart and outputs text that the user should complete transaction.
Ultimately, I would like to automate this script and add a feature that sends a text rather than output to text file
